### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bruno, I'm a software engineer with more than seven years of working experience. I worked for four years in a consultant company designing and implementing scalable and flexible systems.

In 2018 I decided to move on into the iOS world. Currently, I'm working as iOS Tech. Lead at [Houlak](www.houlak.com). I have been involved in several projects of different sizes which gives me the possibility to explore the latest technologies related to the iOS ecosystem.
