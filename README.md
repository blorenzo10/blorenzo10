### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bruno, I'm an iOS Engineer from Uruguay working for [Houlak](www.houlak.com). :computer:

Before I started my journey as an iOS Developer I worked almost five years as Software Engineer in a consultant company here in Uruguay. I had the possibility to learn a lot there, not only the aspects related to our profession but also the soft skills that every software engineer needs. I worked on several projects of different sizes with different requirements which helped me to learn the different points of view that every role inside a project can have.

In my last year at college, I had an iOS development course, and that was when my path into the iOS world begun. In the past three+ years, I have been working on different projects of different scales using Swift and Obj-c as well.

Besides my current job, I like to create personal projects to test my skills as an iOS engineer and to explore the new features releases in the Apple ecosystem as well.
